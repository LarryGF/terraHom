## Rtorrent-Flood

- Go to <https://rtorrent.{your> domain}.duckdns.org
- Create username and password and keep them in mind, you will need them later
- Paste the following path in the socket `/config/.local/share/rtorrent/rtorrent.sock/config/.local/share/rtorrent/rtorrent.sock`

## Jackett (DEPRECATED)

- __Jackett has been deprecated in favor of prowlarr, it is way easier to sync the indexers that way__
- Go to `https://jackett.{your domain}.duckdns.org/UI/Dashboard`
- Add your desired indexers
- Don't close the page yet, since you'll need it to add indexers to Sonarr/Radarr

## Prowlarr

- Go to `https://prowlar.{your> domain}.duckdns.org`

- Add your desired indexers

  - Go to the apps (#sonarr/radarr) and get their API keys by going to Settings -> General -> Security

- Go to Settings -> Apps and add your deployed apps:

  - For all apps `Prowlar server` will be: `http://prowlar:9696`

    - For all apps the `App server` will be the name of the app, and you should get the port from the table below table:

    | Service         | Port |
    | --------------- | ---- |
    | radarr          | 7878 |
    | sonarr          | 8989 |
    | whisparr-radarr | 6969 |

  - For instance, for `sonarr`, `App server` would be `http://sonarr:8989`

- After you've finished adding the apps you might want to trigger a `Sync app indexers`

## [Sonarr/Radarr](https://wiki.servarr.com/radarr)

- Go to Radarr/Sonarr:  `https://{radarr/sonarr}.{your domain}.duckdns.org`
- Go to Settings -> Media Management: set root folder to /downloads, that's where the `media`shared volume will be mounted
- Go to Settings -> Download Clients: Add a new `Flood` downloader:
  - Name: Flood
  - Host: `rtorrent-rtorrent-flood`
  - Port: `3000`
  - Set username and password from [Flood](#rtorrent-flood) step

- Add new profiles to support other languages

- If the categories don't match between Radarr/Sonarr and Prowlarr it might fail silently

## Plex/Ombi

- Login to Plex by visiting: `https://plex.{your domain}.duckdns.org`
